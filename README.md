# Material/Vue.js Sidebar Component

 A simple sidebar component made with [Material Design Lite](getmdl.io) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/).


### How to build


```
$ npm install -g gulp
```

```
$ npm install
```

After that go into the repository and execute

```
$ gulp
```

* This will generate a public folder, compile all styles, copy and optimize images, lint and uglify JavaScript and minify templates.
* The server will start at port 1337 (http://localhost:1337) and all the assets files will be watched by BrowserSync when you save then.
